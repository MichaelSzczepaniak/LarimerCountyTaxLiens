Tax liens are issued by many states in order to ensure that all the property tax revenue owed to respective county municipalities are collected in spite of the fact that not all property owners pay their taxes when they are due.

In Larimer county Colorado, tax liens are sold annually to individuals by way of public auction (typically held in November).  Individuals who purchase tax liens essentially pay the unpaid taxes due the county and are compensated by the overdue fees which property owners must pay when they eventually settle their tax bill.

Purchasers of tax liens receive their original purchase price of the lien plus some amount of interest.  The amount of interest received depends upon two factors. The first factor is the interest rate which is applied to the outstanding amount.  The second factor is the amount of time it takes for the property owner who owes the tax to pay off the outstanding lien.  When a property owner pays off their lien it is typically referred to as a "redemption" of the lien.

ROI = p_0i_mm_0 + p_1i_mm_2 + ... + p_ni_mm_n = p_0i_mm_0 + \sum_{j=1}^np_ji_mm_j
